# Overview
I made this project because I came across an ascii image. Given my knowledge of image manipulation, I decided to do it myself. I also saw it as an opportunity to update my nvim launcher.

# How Program Works
This program was broken into 2 parts:
1. Converting an image in current directory to an ascii image.
2. Take an image from the camera and convert that into an ascii image. 

# How To Run
Make sure that you have the following libraries install in your virtual environment
'   
    Opencv
    Numpy
    Pillow
    Time
    OS
'

Then simply run:
    python3 project.py
